## About This Project

In this project, I created an API powered bookmark application, refactored using React instead of jQuery.If you would like to, view the jQuery powered bookmark application [here](https://github.com/thinkful-ei-unicorn/elinam-bookmark-app/deployments/activity_log?environment=github-pages) The project has a RESTful API and allows for CRUD actions. Use this bookmark app to collected websites and links you want to share or come back to while clicking through the web.
